# Front-End / Full Stack Software Engineering. Challenge Instructions

## Overview

You are tasked with creating a front-end application for the provided design. This
application is intended to be a mock design and will not be connected to any API.
Technical Requirements

1. **Technology Stack**: Your application must be developed using either ReactJS,
   TypeScript, Aurelia, VueJS, or Angular. Choose one that best showcases your
   skills.

2. **Pure CSS**: No style frameworks are allowed for this challenge. You are
   required to use pure CSS to style the applicaton. This will demonstrate your
   ability to work with fundamental web technologies.

3. **Responsive Design**: Your application must be responsive and adapt
   gracefully to different screen sizes. This includes mobile, tablet, and desktop
   views.

4. **Card Proportions**: Pay special atention to the proportions of the cards in
   the design. Their dimensions should remain consistent across all screen
   sizes to ensure a uniform user experience.

    Design and Assets

    - Mock Design: Use the PDF design as reference. Mobile design is not
      included, this is an opportunity to showcase your experience on how best
      to adapt controllers and elements to smaller screens.

    - Asset Substitution: As no assets are provided, you are encouraged to use
      images from your favorite game as substitutes. This is an opportunity to add
      a personal touch to the design.

## Submission Guidelines

-   **Code Repository**: Submit your code via a public GitHub repository. Ensure
    that your code is well-documented and organized.

-   **Live Demo**: If possible, provide a link to a live demo of your application.

-   **Documentation**: Include a README file with instructions on how to run
    your application and any relevant information about your design choices.
